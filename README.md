# Post sharing application
### Backend
* Install node modules by 'npm install'.
* config folder contains keys of different API's used.
* Middleware contains a file that will be used in signing up and other features of this application. Instead of writing code again and again it is built inside a folder and can be  pasted according to our use.
* Under models section 2 databases schemas are created, User and Posts . In User schema it will contain the details of the user once signed in and other schema contains the details of the posts that is uploaded by the user.
* In routes section, contains the requests and responses of the frontend section. 
* package.json contains all the details of the dependencies involved in the creation of this application and is created by 'npm init'.

# Work Undergoing
* Instead of using JsonWebToken for authentication , trying to use google console API and AUTH2.0  for authentication so that the user can sign in with the email directly instead of writing the passwords again and again.
* Working on search query , currently is searching with the email id's instead of username.
* Struggling to write a query of delete account from the database.
