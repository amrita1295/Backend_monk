# Post sharing application
**Backend**
* Install node modules by 'npm install'.
* config folder contains keys of different API's used.

# Work Left
* Instead of using JsonWebToken for authentication , trying to use google console API and AUTH2.0  for authentication so that the user can sign in with the email directly instead of writing the passwords again and again.
* Working on search query , currently is searching with the email id's instead of username.
* Struggling to write a query of delete account from the database.
